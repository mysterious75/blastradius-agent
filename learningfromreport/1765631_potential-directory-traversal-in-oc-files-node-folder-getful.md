# HackerOne Report #1765631 — Potential directory traversal in OC\Files\Node\Folder::getFullPath

## Full disclosure

https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/67551f379f3105d117b9d19095dd381450fe40dd/lib/private/Files/Node/Folder.php#L68-L73
is validating and normalizing the string in the wrong order.

Validation checks for `/../` kind of situations and `normalizePath` later on replaces `\` with `/`, so it would be possible to get `/../` again.

```php
	public function getFullPath($path) {
		if (!$this->isValidPath($path)) {
			throw new NotPermittedException('Invalid path');
		}
		return $this->path . $this->normalizePath($path);
	}
```

## Impact

The function seems to be used in newFile() and newFolder() items, allowing to create paths outside of ones own space and overwriting stuff from others.
