# HackerOne Report #3619288 — RCE + PAT Exfiltration via pull_request_target in privacy-configuration/auto-respond-pr.yml — Direct Supply Chain to All DDG Browsers

- **Program:** unknown

## Full disclosure

## Summary

The `duckduckgo/privacy-configuration` repository's `.github/workflows/auto-respond-pr.yml` GitHub Actions workflow uses `pull_request_target` trigger, checks out **the fork's repository as both "base" and "PR" branches** (attacker controls both), then executes `npm ci` + `node index.js` on the attacker-controlled code. The `PRIVACY_CONFIG_PAT` secret — a Personal Access Token used for PR auto-approval — is exposed in subsequent workflow steps. Additionally, the `sync_asana_on_close` job unconditionally exposes `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `GH_RO_PAT` when any PR (including fork PRs) is closed.

**This is a separate vulnerability from the previously reported `content-scope-scripts/semver-label.yml` finding.** Different repository, different secrets, different attack path, and a shorter supply chain — `privacy-configuration` is consumed via a floating `main` branch dependency with no tag or SHA pinning.

## Vulnerability Details

### Root Cause

The workflow uses `pull_request_target` (privileged context with secrets) and contains two critical flaws:

1. **Fork checkout as "base"**: The base branch checkout uses `repository: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}` — this checks out the **fork's** repo, not the actual base. The attacker controls BOTH checkouts.
2. **Arbitrary code execution**: `npm ci` and `node index.js` run on fork code with `PRIVACY_CONFIG_PAT` available in subsequent steps.

### Vulnerable Workflow (auto-respond-pr.yml)

---

**Cross-reference:** This vulnerability is separate from report #3619287 (content-scope-scripts/semver-label.yml). Different repository, different secrets, different attack path, and a shorter supply chain.

## Impact

1. **RCE + PRIVACY_CONFIG_PAT Theft**: Any GitHub user can execute arbitrary code on the Actions runner by opening a fork PR. The PRIVACY_CONFIG_PAT — used for PR auto-approval — is exfiltrable. This PAT likely has repo scope, enabling the attacker to approve their own PRs, push to branches, and access private repository contents.

2. **Base Branch Impersonation**: The "base" checkout retrieves the fork's code, not the real base. Any diff-based validation is defeated. The attacker controls 100% of the code the workflow operates on.

3. **Direct Supply Chain — All DuckDuckGo Browsers**: privacy-configuration controls tracker blocking, fingerprint protection, and privacy features for ALL DDG browsers. The duckduckgo-privacy-extension uses a floating main dependency with no tag or SHA pin. An attacker who steals PRIVACY_CONFIG_PAT can approve and merge a malicious PR to main, and the poisoned configuration propagates directly into the next build of every DuckDuckGo product — Android, iOS, macOS, Chrome extension, Firefox extension.

4. **Silent Privacy Degradation**: Unlike code injection (which may crash or behave visibly), a poisoned privacy configuration can silently disable tracker blocking or fingerprint protections for all users without any visible indicator. Users would believe they are protected while their privacy protections are disabled.

5. **Additional Secrets**: ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN and GH_RO_PAT are unconditionally exposed when any fork PR is closed, enabling access to DuckDuckGo's Asana project management and GitHub read access.
