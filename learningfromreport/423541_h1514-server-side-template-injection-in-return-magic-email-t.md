## Full disclosure

**Summary:**
Possible template injection in return magic email templates.

**Description:** 
I've been playing with return magic workflow email templates and there seems to be some kinda of template injection but I am not sure if it's exploitable or even valid.
Here is why I think it could be vulnerable: 
I set the email template to the following and then test the template and then the results go to my gmail inbox.
`{{ this }} ` -> `[Object Object]` 
`{{ this.__proto__ }}` --> `[Object Object]`
`{{ this.__proto__.constructor.name }}` --> `Object`
I couldn't go further but it seems like the backend is NodeJs.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Install Return Magic app
2. Navigate to `https://<shop>.myshopify.com/admin/apps/returnmagic`
3. Open Settings tab from the top menu and then open **Emails** --> **Workflow** from the left menu
4. Click Edit for any email template then at the editor click the code icon and enter `{{this}}` 
5. Go back to **Workflow** page and click **Send me a test email** for the template you edited then enter your email and check your inbox.
6. You'll see `[Object Object]`
